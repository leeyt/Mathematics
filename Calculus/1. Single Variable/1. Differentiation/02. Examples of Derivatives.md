# Session 02: Examples of Derivatives

## Example 1: y = 1/x

We'll find the derivative of the function f(x) = 1/x. To do this we will use the formula:

![f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+\Delta x)-f(x_0)}{\Delta x}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%27%28x%29%3D%5Clim_%7B%5CDelta%20x%20%5Cto%200%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bf%28x_0&plus;%5CDelta%20x%29-f%28x_0%29%7D%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D)

Graphically, we will be finding the slope of the tangent line at an arbitrary point ![(x_0, 1/x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%201/x_0%29) on the graph of y = 1/x.

We start by computing the slope of the secant line:

Next, we see what happens to the slopes of the secant lines as ![Delta x](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20x) tends to zero:

![Slope of the limit of the secant line](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%27%28x%29%3D%5Clim_%7B%5CDelta%20x%20%5Cto%200%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f%7D%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7Bx_0%5E2%7D)

One thing to keep in mind when working with derivatives: it may be tempting to plug in ![Delta x](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20x) = 0 right away. If you do this, however, you will always en up with ![0/0](\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}=\frac{0}{0}). You will always need to do some cancellation to get at the answer.

We've computed that ![f'(x)=\frac{-1}{x_0^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%27%28x%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7Bx_0%5E2%7D). Is this correct? How might we check our work? First of all, f'(x\_0) is negative--as is the slope of the tangent line on the graph of y = 1/x. Secondly, as x\_0 -> infinity, the tangent line is less and less steep. So ![\frac{-1}{x_0^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B-1%7D%7Bx_0%5E2%7D) should get closer to 0 as x\_0 increases, which it does.
