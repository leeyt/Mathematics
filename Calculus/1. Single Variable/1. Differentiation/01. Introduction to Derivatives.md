# Session 01: Introduction to Derivatives

## Geometric interpretation of differentiation

The derivative of f(x) at ![x = x_0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%20%3D%20x_0) is the slope of the tangent  line to the graph of f(x) at the point ![(x_0, f(x_0))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20f%28x_0%29%29). 

But what is a tangent line?

* It is __NOT__ just a line that meets the graph at one point.
* It is the _limit_ of the secant lines joining points P = ![(x_0, f(x_0))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20f%28x_0%29%29) and Q on the graph of f(x) as Q approaches P.

The tangent line touches the graph at ![(x_0, f(x_0))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20f%28x_0%29%29); the slope of the tangent line matches the direction of the graph at that point. The tangent line is the straight line that best approximates the graph at that point.

Given a graph of our function, it’s not hard for us to draw the tangent line to the graph. However, we’ll want to do computations involving the tangent line and so will need a computational method of ﬁnding the tangent line.

How do we compute the equation of the line tangent to the graph of the function f(x) at a point P = ![(x_0, y_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20y_0%29)? 

We know that the equation of the straight line with slope m through the point ![(x_0, y_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20y_0%29) is , so ![y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%20-%20y_0%20%3D%20m%28x%20-%20x_0%29) in the abstract we know the equation of the tangent line.

To get a speciﬁc equation for the line, we’ll need to know the coordinates x<sub>0</sub> and y<sub>0</sub> of the point P. 

If we know x<sub>0</sub>, we can ﬁnd ![y_0 = f(x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_0%20%3D%20f%28x_0%29) by substituting the value x<sub>0</sub> into the expression for f(x). 

The second thing we need to know is the slope, ![y = f'(x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%20%3D%20f%27%28x_0%29), which we call the _derivative_ of f.

Definition: 

The derivative ![f'(x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%27%28x_0%29) of f at x<sub>0</sub> is the slope of the tangent line to y = f(x) at the point P = ![(x_0, y_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20y_0%29).

## Limit of Secants

We’re still trying to ﬁnd a computational method of ﬁnding the equation of the tangent line – how do we compute the value of m?

In general, how do we know which lines are tangent lines and which lines are not?

A secant line is a line that joins two points on a curve. If the two points are close enough together, the slope of the secant line is close to the slope of the curve. 

We want to ﬁnd the slope of the tangent line, m — which equals the slope of the curve — and we use the slopes of secant lines to do this.

Suppose PQ is a secant line of the graph of f(x). We can ﬁnd the slope of the graph at P by calculating the slope of PQ as Q moves closer and closer to P (and the slope of PQ gets closer and closer to m).

The tangent line equals the limit of secant lines PQ as Q → P; here P is ﬁxed and Q varies.

## Slope as Ratio

While we’re still thinking geometrically, we can now use symbols and formulas in our computation.

![Geometric definition of derivative][2]

We start with a point ![P = (x_0, f(x_0))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%20%3D%20%28x_0%2C%20f%28x_0%29%29). We move over a tiny horizontal distance Δx (pronounced “delta x” and also called “the change in x”) and ﬁnd point ![Q = (x_0 + \Delta x, f(x_0 + \Delta x))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q%20%3D%20%28x_0%20&plus;%20%5CDelta%20x%2C%20f%28x_0%20&plus;%20%5CDelta%20x%29%29). 

These two points lie on a secant line of the graph of f(x); we will compute the slope of this line. 

The vertical difference between P and Q is ![\Delta f = f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5CDelta%20f%20%3D%20f%28x_0%20&plus;%20%5CDelta%20x%29%20-%20f%28x_0%29).

The slope of the secant PQ is rise divided by run, or the ratio ![\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f%7D%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D). 

We’ve said that the tangent line is the limit of the secant lines. It is also true that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines. 

In other words,

![m = \lim_{Q \to P} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3D%20%5Clim_%7BQ%20%5Cto%20P%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f%7D%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D%20%3D%20%5Clim_%7B%5CDelta%20x%20%5Cto%200%7D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20f%7D%7B%5CDelta%20x%7D)

## Main Formula

We started with a point P on the graph of y = f(x) which had coordinates ![(x_0, f(x_0))](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_0%2C%20f%28x_0%29%29). 

We then found a point Q on the the graph which was Δx units to
the right of P. The coordinates of Q must be (x<sub>0</sub> + Δx, f(x<sub>0</sub> + Δx)). We can now write the following formula for the derivative:

![Formula of a derivative at a fixed point][3]

This is by far the most important formula in Lecture 1; it is the formula that we use to compute the derivative f(x<sub>0</sub>), which equals the slope of the tangent line to the graph at P. A machine could use this formula together with the coordinates (x<sub>0</sub>, f(x<sub>0</sub>)) of the point P to draw the tangent line to the graph of y = f(x) at the point P.

## Recitation: Definition of Derivatives

Let ![f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%28x%29%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1&plus;x%5E2%7D)

Graph y = f(x) and compute f'(x).
